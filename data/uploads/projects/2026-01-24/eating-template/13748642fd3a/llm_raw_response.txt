> **Visual Analysis**: Subject is an orange tabby cat. Left Static Anchor: KFC-style bucket with chick-buns and hanging blue plush hood. Right Static Anchor: Tall blue drink topped with pineapple and hanging Christmas stockings. Center: Plate of cat-themed canelé cakes.
>
> **Proximity Check**: Closest items are the Center Cakes and Left Chicken Bucket. The Right Drink is also reachable. Items on the back shelves (plushies, wreath) are too far in the background and are REJECTED to prevent arm distortion.
>
